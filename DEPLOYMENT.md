# Production Deployment Guide

## Overview

This AI-powered talent acquisition platform is now production-ready with enterprise-grade security, scalability, and monitoring features.

## Production Features

### Security & Middleware
- **Security Headers**: Helmet.js with Content Security Policy
- **CORS Configuration**: Configurable origins for development and production
- **Rate Limiting**: API and file upload rate limiting
- **Request Size Limits**: 50MB limit for large file uploads
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with development/production modes

### Database & Storage
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Full Neon Database integration with Drizzle ORM
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connections
- **Schema Management**: Automated migrations with Drizzle Kit
- **Data Integrity**: Type-safe database operations

### Monitoring & Health
- **Health Check Endpoint**: `/health` endpoint for monitoring
- **Request Logging**: Comprehensive API request logging
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error logging and tracking
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time and status tracking

## Deployment on Replit

### 1. Environment Setup

The platform is already configured for Replit deployment. Required environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...  # Automatically set by Replit
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...         # Required for AI features
NODE_ENV=production           # Set for production mode
```

### 2. Database Setup

The database is automatically configured with your Neon PostgreSQL instance:

```bash
# Database schema is automatically pushed on startup
npm run db:push
```

### 3. Security Configuration

Production security features are automatically enabled:
- Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)
- File upload limits (10 uploads per hour)
- CORS restricted to `.replit.app` and `.replit.dev` domains
- Security headers and CSP policies

### 4. Deploy to Production

Click the "Deploy" button in your Replit workspace:

1. **Auto-Deploy**: Replit will automatically build and deploy your application
2. **Custom Domain**: Configure a custom domain if needed
3. **SSL Certificate**: Automatically handled by Replit
4. **Health Monitoring**: Use the `/health` endpoint for uptime monitoring

## Production Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] OpenAI API key is set and valid
- [ ] Database connection is working (`npm run db:push`)
- [ ] Test file upload functionality
- [ ] Verify candidate processing pipeline
- [ ] Check security headers and CORS settings

### After Deployment
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `https://your-app.replit.app/health`
- [ ] Upload test candidate file
- [ ] Verify real-time processing works
- [ ] Check error logging and monitoring
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality

## Performance & Scaling

### Current Configuration
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **File Processing**: Async job processing with progress tracking
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 with error handling and retries
- **Caching**: HTTP 304 responses for static resources

### Scaling Recommendations
1. **Database Indexing**: Add indexes for frequently queried fields
2. **Caching Layer**: Consider Redis for session and data caching
3. **File Storage**: Use cloud storage for large files
4. **Background Jobs**: Implement job queues for heavy processing

## Security Best Practices

### Implemented
- Content Security Policy
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Request size limits
- Error message sanitization
- CORS protection

### Additional Recommendations
- API key authentication for sensitive endpoints
- Session management for multi-user access
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular security audits

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Checks
Monitor the `/health` endpoint for:
- Application status
- Database connectivity
- Environment information
- Uptime metrics

### Log Monitoring
Key metrics to monitor:
- API response times
- Error rates
- File processing completion rates
- Database query performance

### Maintenance Tasks
- Regular database backups
- Log cleanup and rotation
- Security updates
- Performance optimization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Check DATABASE_URL environment variable
   - Verify Neon database is running
   - Run `npm run db:push` to sync schema

2. **OpenAI API Errors**
   - Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is valid
   - Check API rate limits and quotas
   - Monitor error logs for specific issues

3. **File Upload Issues**
   - Check file size limits (50MB max)
   - Verify rate limiting settings
   - Ensure proper CSV/Excel format

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor database query performance
   - Check rate limiting configuration
   - Review error logs for bottlenecks

## Support

For production support:
1. Check application logs in Replit console
2. Monitor database performance in Neon dashboard
3. Review OpenAI usage and billing
4. Use health endpoint for system status

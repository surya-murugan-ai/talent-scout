    "summary": "AI Product Engineer with 2+ years of experience and proven track record of transforming cutting-edge Generative AI research into commercially viable products. I design and deploy Agentic AI systems, multi-modal LLM applications, and enterprise-scale RAG pipelines that deliver measurable business outcomes â€” including 30% operational cost savings and 25%+ user engagement growth. My expertise spans the full AI lifecycle: model architecture, LangGraph/LangChain orchestration, LLMOps pipelines, and scalable deployments on AWS, GCP, and Azure. With a strong foundation in mathematics and hands-on experience in LLM fine-tuning (LoRA/QLoRA) and vector database integration (Pinecone, ChromaDB), I build robust, production-ready AI solutions that deliver lasting impact.",

        "description": "Architected and deployed a conversational Agentic AI system that automated initial resume screening and applicant query handling, reducing recruiter workload by 30%. Designed and implemented an enterprise-grade RAG pipeline with LangChain + Pinecone, improving recruiter satisfaction scores by 20% through precise, context-aware candidate insights. Fine-tuned Google Gemini LLM using LoRA for domain-specific talent analysis, enhancing accuracy of candidate qualification matching by 22%. Deployed the agent as a scalable microservice on AWS using Docker and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring 99.9% uptime and seamless integration into HR platforms. Established a feedback-driven active learning loop that improved model precision from 84% to 96% in three months based on recruiter-approved training data. Developed an interactive recruiter dashboard in Streamlit for managing AI agents, reviewing candidate summaries, and tracking hiring KPIs in real time. Collaborated with the HR analytics team to integrate agent insights into company-wide recruitment dashboards, enabling leadership to track hiring efficiency and candidate quality trends in real time.",

Integrated a custom LLM for exercise suggestions, diet planning, progress tracking, and calorie estimation, achieving 92% accuracy in form detection via a YOLO-based CV pipeline. Built a real-time visual feedback system that processed user-uploaded images to provide adaptive coaching, increasing workout completion rates by 25%. Leveraged LangGraph to orchestrate adaptive multi-agent workflows that evolved recommendations based on live user feedback and activity tracking. Designed and deployed a Streamlit UI for an engaging and motivational user experience, incorporating advanced prompt engineering for personalized conversation flows. Led end-to-end project lifecycle management, collaborating with designers, backend engineers, and product managers, and conducting weekly Jira-based sprint reviews and code walkthroughs. Implemented MLOps best practices with MLflow tracking and GCP Vertex AI pipelines, reducing model retraining time by 40% and ensuring reproducibility of experiments.",
